### Security Assessments

- Vulnerability Assessments
	- Cost-effective method of identifying low hanging vulnerabilities
	- Skillset needed to conduct assessments is low
	- May not identify vulnerabilities requiring manual inspection
	- Potential false positives
	- Generic recommendations that may not be relevant
- Penetration Test
	- Provides an in-depth analysis of vulnerabilities and overall organizational security
	- Provides logical and realistic recommendations tailored to the target organization
	- Cost significantly more time and money
	- Requires a more in-depth security knowledge
- Security Audits
- Bug Bounties
- Red Team Assessment
- Purple Team Assessment (Red Team + Blue Team)

### Vulnerability Assessment

- Methodology
	1. Conduct Risk Identification And Analysis
	2. Develop Vulnerability Scanning Policies
	3. Identify the types of Scans
	4. Configure The Scan
	5. Perform The Scan
	6. Evaluate And Consider Possible Risks
	7. Interpret The Scan Results
	8. Create A Remediation & Migration Plan
- Key Terms:
	- Vulnerability: Weakness or bug in an organizations environment Vulnerabilities can be registered through MITRE's [Common Vulnerability Exposure database](https://cve.mitre.org/) and receive a [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) score to determine severity.
	- Threat: A new incident with potential to harm a system.
	- Risk: The potential for damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability
	- Threat + Vulnerability = Risk
	- Exploit: An Exploit is any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness. Many exploits are available through open-source platforms such as [Exploit-db](https://exploit-db.com/) or [the Rapid7 Vulnerability and Exploit Database](https://www.rapid7.com/db/).
- Asset Management
	- Asset Inventory
	- Application and System Inventory
